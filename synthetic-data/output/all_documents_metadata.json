This expansion significantly increases accessibility to Meta\u2019s virtual reality platform and marks a key step in the company\u2019s vision of building the metaverse.\n\nUntil today, Horizon Worlds was primarily accessible through Meta Quest VR headsets. By making the platform available on Android devices, users can now engage with Horizon Worlds through compatible smartphones and tablets, without requiring a VR headset. This enables more people to create, explore, and connect in virtual environments. Android users will be able to access select experiences curated for mobile devices, including social games and collaborative workspaces.\n\nThis move underscores Meta\u2019s commitment to making the metaverse more accessible and inclusive. The Android rollout will be phased, beginning today in North America and Europe, with broader global availability planned over the coming weeks. This phased approach allows Meta to ensure a seamless user experience and address any technical challenges as they arise.\n\n\"Expanding Horizon Worlds to Android is a crucial step in lowering the barrier to entry for the metaverse,\" said Vishal Shah, VP of Metaverse at Meta. \"We believe that social connection and immersive experiences should be available to as many people as possible. This launch builds upon our existing efforts to broaden access to VR and AR technologies, and we\u2019re excited to see how Android users will contribute to and shape the future of Horizon Worlds.\"\n\nMeta is a social technology company focused on building connections through Facebook, Instagram, and virtual reality.

    "content": "**Tesla, Inc. - Q1 2023 Financial Report**\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nTesla (TSLA) achieved a mixed performance in Q1 2023, navigating a complex macroeconomic environment and intensified competition. While revenue growth continued, profitability was impacted by price adjustments implemented to maintain market share and drive volume. We achieved revenue of $23.33 billion, a 24% increase year-over-year, but gross profit margins contracted to 19.3% due to pricing pressures and increased raw material costs. We remain committed to long-term growth and technological innovation.\n\n**Revenue and Growth:**\n\nAutomotive revenue reached $20.43 billion, driven primarily by Model 3 and Model Y deliveries. Energy generation and storage revenue contributed $1.53 billion, demonstrating continued growth in this vital sector. Services and other revenue accounted for the remaining $1.37 billion. While vehicle deliveries grew by 36% year-over-year, the average selling price of our vehicles decreased due to strategic price adjustments intended to broaden accessibility and capture a larger market share. Regionally, North America continues to be our largest market, with significant growth also observed in Europe and China.\n\n**Key Business Highlights:**\n\nDuring Q1, Tesla continued its expansion of Supercharger network, exceeding 45,000 stalls globally. Production ramp-up at Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg progressed according to plan, contributing to overall production capacity. We also made strides in Full Self-Driving (FSD) software development and are actively expanding the FSD Beta program. Moreover, we continue to invest significantly in research and development, focusing on next-generation vehicles, battery technology, and AI capabilities.\n\n**Market Conditions and Competitive Landscape:**\n\nThe Electric Vehicle (EV) market is experiencing rapid growth, but is also becoming increasingly competitive. Incumbent automakers and new entrants are introducing a growing number of EV models, putting pressure on pricing and market share. Macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation and interest rate hikes, are impacting consumer demand and affordability. The clean energy sector is also experiencing increased competition, particularly in the residential solar and energy storage markets.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements and Guidance:**\n\nTesla remains focused on increasing production capacity, driving down costs, and expanding its product portfolio. We reiterate our long-term target of 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries, though short-term growth may fluctuate due to macroeconomic factors and supply chain constraints. We are investing heavily in future technologies and believe that our superior technology, manufacturing capabilities, and brand strength will allow us to maintain a leadership position in the EV and clean energy markets. We anticipate gross margins to improve in the second half of the year as we realize cost efficiencies and new product offerings.",

While facing headwinds from currency fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainties, the company achieved continued growth in key strategic areas. Q4 performance underscores the strength of SAP's cloud-first strategy and the increasing customer demand for its RISE with SAP and S/4HANA Cloud offerings. Overall, SAP met revised expectations, demonstrating disciplined execution.\n\n**Revenue Performance:**\n\nTotal revenue for Q4 2022 reached approximately \u20ac8.03 billion, reflecting a reported increase of 5% year-over-year. Cloud revenue continued to be the primary growth driver, surging by 30% to \u20ac3.26 billion. This growth was partially offset by a decline in software licenses revenue, which decreased by 15% as customers increasingly migrate towards cloud solutions. Services revenue remained relatively stable at \u20ac1.05 billion. Regionally, EMEA demonstrated modest growth, while the Americas saw a stronger performance driven by large enterprise deals. Asia Pacific showed continued expansion, particularly in strategic growth markets like India and Japan.\n\n**Key Business Highlights:**\n\nDuring Q4, SAP continued to gain significant traction with its RISE with SAP offering, securing key wins across diverse industries. Customer adoption of S/4HANA Cloud also accelerated, further solidifying SAP's position as the leader in intelligent enterprise solutions. Notable achievements included the successful integration of acquired technologies into the Business Technology Platform and strategic partnerships designed to enhance SAP's ecosystem. Furthermore, SAP made notable advancements in sustainability solutions, reflecting growing market demand for ESG-focused offerings.\n\n**Market Conditions and Competitive Landscape:**\n\nThe Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) market remained highly competitive in Q4 2022. Economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures led to increased scrutiny on IT spending. While SAP maintained its leading market position, competitors like Oracle, Microsoft, and Workday continued to aggressively pursue cloud ERP market share. SAP differentiates itself through its comprehensive product portfolio, industry-specific solutions, and established customer base.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements and Guidance:**\n\nLooking ahead, SAP anticipates continued growth in cloud revenue, driven by ongoing adoption of S/4HANA Cloud and RISE with SAP. For fiscal year 2023, SAP projects cloud revenue to be in the range of \u20ac14.5 billion to \u20ac15.0 billion. While macroeconomic uncertainties are expected to persist, SAP remains confident in its ability to execute its strategy, deliver innovative solutions, and generate sustainable, profitable growth.

We achieved revenue growth while maintaining a disciplined approach to operating expenses. Revenue for the quarter reached $1.72 billion, representing a 25% year-over-year increase, driven by strong merchant solutions growth and continued expansion of our merchant base. While inflationary pressures and shifting consumer spending patterns persist, Shopify's diversified product offerings and global reach have enabled us to navigate the current environment effectively.\n\n**Revenue Performance:**\nTotal revenue for Q3 2023 was $1.72 billion, up 25% compared to $1.37 billion in Q3 2022. Merchant Solutions revenue increased by 30% year-over-year to $1.25 billion, fuelled by growth in GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) which reached $56.2 billion, a 22% increase from the prior year. Subscription Solutions revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $470 million, indicating healthy expansion in our core platform subscriptions. Geographically, North America remains our largest market, contributing approximately 70% of total revenue, while international markets, particularly EMEA and APAC, are demonstrating promising growth.\n\n**Key Business Highlights:**\nDuring Q3, Shopify continued to invest in product innovation and merchant empowerment. We further enhanced Shopify Payments, seeing increased adoption rates among our merchants. The Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN) also experienced increased throughput as we continue to optimize the network and onboard new merchants. Strategic partnerships with social media platforms continued to drive traffic and sales to our merchants' stores.\n\n**Market Conditions and Competitive Landscape:**\nThe e-commerce platform sector remains highly competitive, with established players and emerging technologies vying for market share. Macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, continue to impact consumer spending and merchant operations. Despite these challenges, the long-term outlook for e-commerce remains positive, and Shopify is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging trends and evolving merchant needs.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements and Guidance:**\nLooking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in Q4 2023, although at a potentially more moderate pace compared to Q3. We expect revenue growth in the low twenties percentage range year-over-year. We remain committed to investing in our platform and expanding our product offerings to drive long-term sustainable growth for our merchants and shareholders.

    "content": "**Spotify Technology S.A. - Q1 2022 Financial Report**\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nSpotify delivered a solid start to 2022, demonstrating continued growth in both user base and revenue amidst a dynamic market environment. Total revenue for Q1 2022 reached \u20ac2.66 billion, reflecting a 24% year-over-year increase. Premium revenue, our core driver, grew 23% year-over-year, underpinned by subscriber additions and ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) improvement. While advertising revenue also contributed positively, escalating costs related to content acquisition and platform investment impacted overall profitability. We remain focused on strategic investments in podcasting, technology enhancements, and geographic expansion to drive long-term sustainable growth.\n\n**Revenue Performance**\n\nTotal revenue for the quarter amounted to \u20ac2.66 billion, up 24% compared to Q1 2021. Premium revenue, constituting the majority of our income, reached \u20ac2.38 billion, up 23% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a 15% increase in Premium subscribers, reaching 182 million globally, and a modest increase in ARPU. Advertising revenue grew to \u20ac282 million, up 31% year-over-year, benefiting from growth in podcast advertising and the expansion of our ad-supported user base.\n\n**Key Business Highlights**\n\nDuring Q1 2022, Spotify continued to expand its podcast catalog, securing exclusive deals with high-profile creators and studios. User engagement in podcasting remained robust, with consumption hours growing significantly year-over-year. Spotify also made advancements in its personalized music recommendations, leveraging AI and machine learning to enhance the user experience. Geographically, Spotify saw strong growth in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and Asia, reflecting the increasing global adoption of music streaming.\n\n**Market Conditions and Competitive Landscape**\n\nThe music streaming industry remains highly competitive, with Spotify facing challenges from established players like Apple Music and Amazon Music, as well as newer entrants. The market is characterized by intense competition for exclusive content, subscriber acquisition, and technological innovation. Macroeconomic factors, including inflation and geopolitical instability, also present potential headwinds. We continue to differentiate through our extensive content library, personalized user experience, and strategic partnerships.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nFor Q2 2022, Spotify anticipates continued subscriber growth and revenue expansion. We project total revenue of \u20ac2.8 - \u20ac3.0 billion, reflecting ongoing investments in content and platform development. We are also managing our operating expenses and will look to improve operating margins while still investing in strategic initiatives. We will continue to monitor market conditions and adapt our strategy to navigate the evolving landscape, remain focused on our long-term growth objectives, and generate shareholder value.",

    "content": "**Airbnb, Inc. - Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Report**\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nAirbnb delivered a strong financial performance in 2022, demonstrating resilience and continued growth in the evolving travel landscape. We achieved record revenue and profitability, driven by sustained demand for unique travel experiences and our increasingly diversified product offerings. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Airbnb's platform has proven adaptable, capturing pent-up travel demand and benefiting from the ongoing shift towards flexible and authentic accommodations.\n\n**Revenue Performance:**\n\nFor the full year 2022, Airbnb generated **\\$8.4 billion** in revenue, a **40% increase** compared to 2021. This growth was fueled by a significant rise in nights and experiences booked, totaling **393.7 million**, an increase of 31% year-over-year. Gross Booking Value reached **\\$63.2 billion**, demonstrating the continued strength of our platform. North America remains our largest market, contributing approximately 45% of total revenue, while EMEA and APAC showed significant growth, driven by the easing of travel restrictions in these regions.\n\n**Key Business Highlights:**\n\nThroughout 2022, Airbnb focused on enhancing the guest and host experience, leading to increased satisfaction and loyalty. Key initiatives included streamlining the onboarding process for new hosts, expanding our \"Categories\" feature to facilitate discovery of unique stays, and enhancing our customer support capabilities. We also saw continued success in our Experiences segment, with increased booking volume and positive feedback. Furthermore, we made strides in expanding our long-term stay offerings, catering to the growing demand for flexible living.\n\n**Market Conditions and Competitive Landscape:**\n\nThe hospitality and travel sector experienced a resurgence in 2022, but competition remains intense. Traditional hotel chains and online travel agencies continue to vie for market share, while alternative accommodation platforms also present a competitive challenge. Airbnb differentiates itself through its unique inventory of homes, experiences, and flexible accommodation options, appealing to travelers seeking authentic and personalized travel experiences. Macroeconomic factors, including inflation and potential recessionary pressures, pose potential risks to future demand.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements and Guidance:**\n\nLooking ahead to 2023, we anticipate continued growth, albeit at a more moderate pace. We expect Q1 2023 revenue to be in the range of **\\$1.75 billion to \\$1.85 billion**. We remain focused on driving operational efficiencies, investing in product innovation, and expanding our reach into new markets. We believe Airbnb is well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth potential of the travel market and deliver sustainable value to our shareholders. We are closely monitoring global economic conditions and will adapt our strategy as needed to navigate potential challenges.",

Mobility gross bookings grew by 15% year-over-year, driven by increased ridership across all major geographic regions and the continued normalization of travel patterns.

This expansion significantly increases access to sustainable transportation options for riders and provides additional earning opportunities for drivers utilizing electric vehicles on the Uber platform.

This expansion aligns with Uber\u2019s ambitious goal to become a zero-emission platform by 2040. The company has been actively investing in programs and initiatives to support drivers in transitioning to EVs, including partnerships with charging providers and incentives for electric vehicle adoption. Comfort Electric rides also contribute to a more sustainable environment in urban areas by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to providing riders with convenient and sustainable transportation options,\u201d said Andrew Macdonald, Senior Vice President, Mobility and Business Operations at Uber. \u201cThe expansion of Comfort Electric to these ten new cities demonstrates our continued investment in electrification and our dedication to creating a greener future for transportation. We\u2019re excited to see the positive impact this will have on communities across the country.\"\n\n**About Uber**\nUber's mission is to create opportunity through movement.

(NYSE: SQ) delivered a solid Q3 2025, demonstrating continued strength in its integrated commerce ecosystem and sustained growth in both the Seller and Cash App ecosystems. Total net revenue for the quarter reached $8.7 billion, representing a 17% year-over-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA was $650 million, reflecting ongoing operational efficiencies and strong performance across key business segments. While navigating a competitive landscape and evolving macroeconomic conditions, Square continues to prioritize innovation and customer acquisition, positioning us for long-term sustainable growth.\n\n**Revenue Performance:**\n\nQ3 2025 total net revenue was $8.7 billion, up 17% from $7.4 billion in Q3 2024. Seller ecosystem revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $4.9 billion, driven by increased Gross Payment Volume (GPV) which reached $75 billion. This growth reflects Square\u2019s success in onboarding larger sellers and expanding its suite of software and hardware solutions for businesses of all sizes. Cash App generated $3.8 billion in revenue, a 24% year-over-year increase, fueled by transaction-based revenue, subscription and services revenue (including Cash App Card and Square Loans), and Bitcoin revenue. Bitcoin revenue, while inherently volatile, contributed $1.8 billion to the Cash App total, up 30% year-over-year.\n\n**Key Business Highlights:**\n\n*   **Seller Ecosystem:** Continued adoption of Square Appointments and Square Marketing, leading to increased subscription revenue. Launched enhanced point-of-sale integrations with key industry partners, expanding reach and improving user experience.\n*   **Cash App Ecosystem:** Increased daily active users (DAU) by 18% year-over-year, demonstrating strong engagement. Rolled out expanded cross-border payment functionality in select international markets, enabling seamless money transfer.\n*   **Square Loans:** Loan origination volume increased by 20% year-over-year, reflecting our commitment to providing accessible capital to small businesses.\n\n**Market Conditions and Competitive Landscape:**\n\nThe financial services and payments sector remains highly competitive, with established players and emerging fintech companies vying for market share. The landscape is further complicated by evolving regulatory environments and macroeconomic uncertainties, including inflation and interest rate fluctuations. We face competition from companies like PayPal, Stripe, Adyen, and a multitude of smaller, niche payment providers. Square continues to differentiate itself through its integrated ecosystem, focusing on providing a comprehensive suite of solutions for both sellers and consumers.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements and Guidance:**\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate continued growth in both the Seller and Cash App ecosystems. We project Q4 2025 total net revenue to be in the range of $9.0 billion to $9.2 billion, representing approximately 15-17% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 is expected to be between $700 million and $720 million. While macroeconomic conditions present potential headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy, driven by product innovation, geographic expansion, and a relentless focus on serving our customers. We will continue to prioritize profitable growth and disciplined expense management.",

Our investment in AI and collaboration tools is aimed at further distinguishing our platform and enhancing our competitive advantage.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements & Guidance:**\n\nLooking ahead to Q4 2024, we anticipate revenue to be in the range of $640 million to $645 million.

We achieved revenue of $8.9 billion, representing a 17% year-over-year increase. While growth has moderated from the hyper-growth phase of recent years, this reflects the increasing scale of our operations and the evolving macroeconomic environment. Profitability continues to be a key focus, and we are pleased to report an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.5% for the quarter.\n\n**Revenue and Growth Metrics**\n\nOur $8.9 billion in revenue was driven primarily by increased transaction volume across our platform. Stripe Payments remained the largest contributor, accounting for $7.8 billion of total revenue, reflecting a 15% YoY increase. Stripe Connect, our platform for marketplaces and SaaS businesses, exhibited strong growth, reaching $800 million in revenue, a 25% YoY increase, highlighting the increasing adoption of platform-based business models. Stripe Treasury, our banking-as-a-service offering, also showed promise, reaching $300 million in revenue and demonstrating the diversification of Stripe.\n\n**Key Business Highlights and Achievements**\n\nDuring Q2, we expanded our partnerships with several large enterprise clients, including Shopify and Amazon, further solidifying our position in the enterprise segment. We also launched localized payment methods in key European markets, driving increased transaction volume in the region. Furthermore, Stripe Identity experienced increased adoption, with verification volumes increasing by 40% YoY.\n\n**Market Conditions and Competitive Landscape**\n\nThe payment processing sector remains highly competitive, with established players like PayPal and Adyen, as well as emerging fintech companies vying for market share. The macro-economic climate continues to pose challenges, with inflationary pressures and potential for recession influencing consumer spending and business investment. However, the increasing digitization of the global economy provides a strong underlying tailwind for the industry.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements and Guidance**\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate continued revenue growth in the range of 15-18% for the remainder of 2025. We will continue to invest strategically in product innovation, particularly in areas such as fraud prevention, embedded finance, and global expansion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to remain in the 13-15% range as we balance growth investments with profitability. We remain committed to providing innovative payment solutions and supporting the growth of our customers in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.",

    "content": "**Shopee - Q3 2022 Financial Report**\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nShopee reports mixed performance for Q3 2022, reflecting a challenging macroeconomic environment and increased competitive pressures across Southeast Asia and Latin America. While revenue growth continued, profitability remains a key focus. We are actively managing costs and optimizing operational efficiency to navigate the current climate and drive sustainable growth.\n\n**Revenue & Growth Metrics:**\n\nTotal revenue for Q3 2022 reached $2.1 billion, representing a 32% year-over-year increase. Marketplace revenue, driven by transaction fees, advertising, and value-added services, accounted for $1.6 billion of this total. Gross orders processed on the platform reached 1.9 billion, a 26% increase year-over-year. However, growth rates have slowed compared to previous quarters, reflecting increased competition and a cautious consumer spending environment. Average Order Value (AOV) saw a slight decrease, standing at approximately $11.05.\n\n**Key Business Highlights:**\n\nDespite headwinds, Shopee achieved several key milestones. We continued to strengthen our leadership position in Southeast Asia, focusing on enhanced user engagement through targeted promotions and improved platform features. Our Shopee Mall segment witnessed strong performance, contributing significantly to overall revenue. Expansion of ShopeePay acceptance across offline merchants in key markets continued, promoting greater integration with the broader retail landscape. We also made progress in streamlining logistics operations, aiming for reduced delivery times and enhanced cost efficiency.\n\n**Market Conditions & Competitive Landscape:**\n\nThe e-commerce sector in Southeast Asia and Latin America is becoming increasingly competitive. Rising inflation and supply chain disruptions are impacting consumer spending. Players like Lazada and Tokopedia are intensifying their efforts to capture market share. To navigate this competitive landscape, Shopee is focusing on differentiation through value-added services, strategic partnerships, and superior user experience.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements & Guidance:**\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate continued macroeconomic uncertainties and competitive pressures. Our primary focus is on achieving sustainable profitability through disciplined cost management, increased operational efficiency, and enhanced monetization strategies. We expect revenue growth in Q4 2022 to be moderately lower than in Q3, reflecting seasonal trends and the prevailing economic climate. While we remain optimistic about the long-term potential of e-commerce in our target markets, we are adopting a cautious approach to growth in the near term, prioritizing profitability and financial stability. We will continue to monitor market conditions closely and adjust our strategies accordingly.",
